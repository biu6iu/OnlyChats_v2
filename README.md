# OnlyChats

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Onlychats is an online forum designed for low-pressure, dynamic conversations among friends and peers. Whether you're sparking a topic-based discussion, asking for advice, or simply chatting with your community, Onlychats offers a space for spontaneous, authentic connection.

Inspired by the depth of Reddit, the community feel of Instagram, and the self-expression of Twitter, OnlyChats brings these elements together in a minimalist, soft-toned interface. The result is a personalised online space where ideas grow naturally and discussions feel genuine.
