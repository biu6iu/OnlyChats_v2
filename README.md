# OnlyChats

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

An online forum which facilitates low pressure, dynamic discussion within a community of friends. Onlychats allows users to spontaneously converse with their peers, incite topic based discussion, ask for advice, and foster connections. Our goal was to build upon the fundamentals of Reddit, the self proclaimed “heart of the internet”, but allow for a more local and conversational vibe. 

We are incorporating the community vibe of Instagram, the self expression aspect of Twitter and the topic prompted discussion of Reddit, creating a minimal and soft user interface, to form Onlychats, an individualised online space where ideas are grown and discussion is inspired.

We want to allow users to have chat about their niches and connect authentically with their community. 

features of the app:
 - user authentication, sign up and login
 - dashboard/feed which shows the current group chats
 - when you enter the chatroom, an easy, low pressure conversation chatroom
 - You can ask for advice, opinion on a topic, weekly favourites, there are also suggested AI prompts if you can’t choose
 - kind of like instagram notes if the notes could create discussion and reddit if it were more conversational and less stress
 - little groupchats designed for discussion, interaction, communication and most importantly fun
 - you can meet more people and join chatrooms based on topics (as opposed to connections)
